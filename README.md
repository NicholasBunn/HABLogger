# README #

This is the source code for my E-Design 314 project. This project was completed in 2019, following the guidlines set out by the University of Stellenbosch's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The code here is the same code used for the final demo and achieved all of the required outcomes, however it is far from optimised and is not particularly efficient. Most notably the use of global variables and the passing of variables to functions needs a complete overhaul as this was done at a time where my coding knowledge was very limited, and I was focussing on getting the code to work as soon as possible rather than on writing good, performance-oriented code.

I am currently not writing much code in C but any suggestions towards improving this code is welcomed as it may help me down the line, or even in some of my current projects. Feel free to have a look through what is in here and provide critisisms where applicable, apologies if the structure and commenting are hard to follow - this was written at a very early stage in my carear where my focus was on making things work (When this was written I hadn't yet found my love for software development).

As far as licencing is concerned, this code falls under Stellenbosch University's Intellectual Property Policy and has been uploaded here to help others and enable others to help me, not for redistribution or reuse.
